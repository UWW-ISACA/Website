# Website Development

## Making Changes to the Website

To modify the website's content, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the `sites` folder:** This directory contains all the website's files, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
2. **Locate the relevant HTML file:** Identify the HTML file corresponding to the page you wish to edit.
3. **Make your changes:** Edit the HTML file using your preferred text editor. 
4. **Save the file:** Ensure you save your changes after editing.
5. **Refresh the website:** Open your web browser and refresh the page you modified. Your changes should be reflected.

**Troubleshooting**

If you don't see your changes immediately after refreshing, try the following:

* **Double-check the correct file:** Ensure you're editing the correct HTML file associated with the page.
* **Clear your browser cache:** Sometimes, browsers cache old versions of websites. Clearing the cache can resolve this issue.
* **Restart your web server (if applicable):** If you're using a local web server, a restart might be necessary for the changes to take effect. 

If you've tried these steps and still don't see your changes, please [open an issue](link-to-issue-tracker) detailing the problem you're encountering.
